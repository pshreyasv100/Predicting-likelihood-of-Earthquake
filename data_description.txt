% Attribute information:
%  1. seismic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the seismic 
% method (a - lack of hazard, b - low hazard, c - high hazard, d - danger state);
%  2. seismoacoustic: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the 
% seismoacoustic method;
%  3. shift: information about type of a shift (W - coal-getting, N -preparation shift);
%  4. genergy: seismic energy recorded within previous shift by the most active geophone (GMax) out of 
% geophones monitoring the longwall;
%  5. gpuls: a number of pulses recorded within previous shift by GMax;
%  6. gdenergy: a deviation of energy recorded within previous shift by GMax from average energy recorded 
% during eight previous shifts;
%  7. gdpuls: a deviation of a number of pulses recorded within previous shift by GMax from average number 
% of pulses recorded during eight previous shifts;
%  8. ghazard: result of shift seismic hazard assessment in the mine working obtained by the 
% seismoacoustic method based on registration coming form GMax only;
%  9. nbumps: the number of seismic bumps recorded within previous shift;
% 10. nbumps2: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^2,10^3)) registered within previous shift;
% 11. nbumps3: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^3,10^4)) registered within previous shift;
% 12. nbumps4: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^4,10^5)) registered within previous shift;
% 13. nbumps5: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^5,10^6)) registered within the last shift;
% 14. nbumps6: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^6,10^7)) registered within previous shift;
% 15. nbumps7: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^7,10^8)) registered within previous shift;
% 16. nbumps89: the number of seismic bumps (in energy range [10^8,10^10)) registered within previous shift;
% 17. energy: total energy of seismic bumps registered within previous shift;
% 18. maxenergy: the maximum energy of the seismic bumps registered within previous shift;
% 19. class: the decision attribute - "1" means that high energy seismic bump occurred in the next shift 
% ("hazardous state"), "0" means that no high energy seismic bumps occurred in the next shift 
% ("non-hazardous state").
